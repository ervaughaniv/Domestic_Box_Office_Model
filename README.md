This code was designed to fit domestic box office grosses to a curve using a simple equation I concocted. The equation requires optimizing three parameters, the most important of which is the final domestic gross. After a film has been out for over a week, the fitting should be pretty decent; I wouldn't try it before then. The jupyter notebook that I used to upload the code is pretty well commented, so I'll keep it short here. Happy for anyone to mess around with this code, and would love to hear if it gives you any interesting insights. You'll probably find that movies released around the holidays don't fit the behavior expected by the equation, so it's not very useful for those films.
